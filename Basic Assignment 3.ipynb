    "1. try: The try block contains the code where you anticipate an error might occur.\n",

    "4. finally (optional): Always executes, regardless of whether an exception occurred or not. It's typically used for cleanup actions (e.g., closing files).\n",
    "5. Exception as e: This catches all exceptions that are subclasses of Python's built-in Exception class. It's a general way to catch any unexpected errors."

    "2. Purpose of the except clause:\n",
